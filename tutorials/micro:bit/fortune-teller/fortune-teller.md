# Fortune Teller

## Overview

In this tutorial we are going to create a simple micro:bit powered Fortune Teller so that when you
shake the micro:bit, it will generate a random answer to a question that you have asked.

You will need 
- An internet connection
- A BBC micro:bit
- A USB cable

## Get Started
Duration: 1:00

Youâ€™ll need to load up EduBlocks. You can do this by opening a web browser of your choice and typing https://app.edublocks.org into the search box. Once you've loaded up EduBlocks, you'll be presented with the mode selector.

Now, we want to select the micro:bit mode. To do this simply click on the blue select button underneath the micro:bit icon. This will load up the micro:bit mode.

Once you've selected the micro:bit mode, you should see it pop up:

## Import the libraries

Now its time to build our code. We can drag our code blocks from the EduBlocks toolbar which is on the left hand side of the screen. The pink
blocks can be found in the basic menu. This will form the start of the code. Both blocks are necessary for this program to work.
